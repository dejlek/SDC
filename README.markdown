SDC - The Stupid D Compiler
===========================
This is the home of a [D](http://d-programming-language.org/) compiler.
SDC is at the moment, particularly stupid; it is a work in progress. Feel free to poke around, but don't expect it to compile your code.
I don't know what I'm doing in terms of compiler writing. If you find some horrible design decision, that's most likely why.

The code is released under the GPL (see the LICENCE file for more details).

Features
========
What follows is a very high level overview of what's done, and what's still to do.
This list is incomplete. SDC is in a state of flux, and this is likely to be out of date.

What Can It Compile?
====================
See the compiler_tests directory for a sample of what is/should-be working.
libs/object.d contains the current (temporary) object.d file for SDC.  

Roadmap
=======
This just me thinking outloud about what features I want, when.

0.1
---
* druntime compiles
* phobos compiles

0.2
---
* inline assembler

0.3
---
* CTFE (this may be required in 0.1, not sure)

1.0
---
* dmd calling convention compatibility
* self hosting

2.0
---
* extern (C++)


Compiling SDC on Linux
=======
You'll need make and the latest DMD installed.
Download the [Clang Binaries for Linux/x86](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#2.9) copy every libLLVM*.a into a directory 'llvm' at the source directory's root.
Make a directory named 'bin'.
Run make.
Copy bin/sdc into the root. Compile the runner using dmd, and run it to run the tests using SDC.

You can build a 64 bit version of SDC using DMD, but it crashes when producing an error. It otherwise works, however.

SDC with DMD/Windows
=======
(These instructions are from Jakob, so please don't contact me regarding them.)

The following are required for LLVM to function on Windows:

* [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) >= 2.9
  * SDC requires the core libraries as a DLL, and the `llc` and `opt` tools
* [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
  * SDC requires `gcc`, as well as GNU make for the makefile

A copy of `llvm-2.9.dll` and `llvm-2.9.lib` in DMD-compatible OMF format can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/downloads/JakobOvrum/SDC/llvm-2.9-Win32-DLL.rar) for convenience.
For the LLVM tools, grab "LLVM Binaries for Mingw32/x86" on the [LLVM download page](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html).
### Setup
Extract the LLVM DLL binary archive to the SDC repository, then build with `make -f Makefile.windows`.
When running SDC, make sure `gcc`, `llc` and `opt` are available in your PATH.

To run the tests, execute `dmd runner.d` to build the test-runner application found in `compiler_tests/`, then run it with `runner`.
